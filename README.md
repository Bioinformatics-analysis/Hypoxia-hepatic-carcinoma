# Hypoxia-hepatic-carcinoma  
## R-code and r data used for analysis and visualization of hepatic carcinoma data 

**The Random Forest analysis was used to feature gene selection (Figure 1A-B)  
Survival status, riskscore rank and heatmap for Figure 2A-B  
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for Figure 3A-D  
Gene Signature independence validation analysis was used for Figure 4-D  
Signature risk score comparison was for Figure 5A-D  
Signature risk score stratified by clinical factors for Figure 6A-H  
Nomogram and calibration plots for Figure 7A-D  
GSEA enrichment analysis was performed for 8A-B**
